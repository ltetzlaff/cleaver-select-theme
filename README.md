# Fork of [Cleaver](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver) Theme: [cleaver-select-theme](https://github.com/select/cleaver-select-theme)

I liked select's approach towards an overview and fragments for a cleaver theme,
so i'll try to make it less hacky and customize it for my own stuff.

## Usage

In *.md that gets fed into `cleaver`:

```
theme: ltetzlaff/cleaver-select-theme
```

## Contributing

Do what you want, but check out [the original theme](https://github.com/select/cleaver-select-theme) first.
